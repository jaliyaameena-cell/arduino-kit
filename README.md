Project Overview

Arduino Launchpad is a full-stack web application that generates structured, beginner-friendly Arduino project guides based on selected sensors and output devices.

The system intelligently:

Accepts selected hardware components

Determines compatibility

Generates a complete step-by-step Arduino project guide

Produces ready-to-paste Arduino IDE code

Falls back to a locally generated guide if OpenAI is unavailable

This project demonstrates:

Full-stack development (React + Node.js)

AI integration using OpenAI API

Structured prompt engineering

Error handling & fallback logic

Hardware-oriented code generation
